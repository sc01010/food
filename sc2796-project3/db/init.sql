Melt butter in skillet over medium heat. 3. When butter is melted, pour in egg mixture. Allow to cook for 1 minute or until the bottom of the egg mixture is just starting to set. Place the edge of a spatula at the edge of the egg mixture and push spatula through to the opposite edge, allowing uncooked egg to redistribute. 4. Continue this until egg mixture is no longer runny.

No need to spray with cooking spray because of the high fat content of the bacon. 6. Lay strips of bacon in the skillet next to each other without overlapping. The bacon will start sizzling and popping as the skillet heats up. 7. Allow bacon to cook until it starts to wrinkle and releases from the bottom of the skillet.

Place lemon juice, lemon zest, garlic, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a large, non-reactive bowl, whisk to combine. With the tip of a sharp knife, cut into the underside (skinless) of each chicken piece one or two times by about 1/2 an inch. (This will help the marinade penetrate.) Place the chicken pieces in the bowl and turn to coat with the marinade. Place in the refrigerator and marinate for 1 to 2 hours. 2. Preheat oven to 425°F. Remove chicken from marinade and place in a single layer in a large baking dish, skin side up. Reserve the marinade. Use a pastry brush to brush melted butter on each piece of chicken. 3. Bake for 20 minutes and baste the chicken pieces generously with the reserved marinade. Continue baking for another 15 to 25 minutes (a total of 35 to 45 minutes), until the skins are crispy brown, and the chicken is cooked through, juices running clear (internal temperature of 165°F). Depending on the size of the breasts, they may be ready before the thighs, so if you are cooking a mix of chicken parts, keep that in mind, you may have to take them out of the oven before the thighs. 4. Remove from the oven and let the chicken rest, covered in foil, for 10 minutes before serving. 5. Pour the juices from the pan into a serving bowl. Use a tablespoon to skim the fat off the top (save the fat for cooking with later, or discard, but do not discard down the drain or it will solidify and clog your drain).

Reduce the heat to medium. Cook the salmon, occasionally pressing down on the flesh, until the surface is golden brown, crispy, and easily releases from the pan, about 4 to 5 minutes. The salmon will be about 75 to 80% cooked through. 5. Using tongs, carefully flip the salmon over. Gently press the surface to make direct contact with the pan, do not move the fillets. Cook until the edges are opaque, and the center is slightly translucent, about 1 to 2 minutes. The internal temperature should read 120°F (49°C) for medium-rare, or 130°F (54°C) for medium. 6. Transfer the salmon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain the excess grease. Do not discard the pan. 7. Heat the same pan used to cook the salmon over medium heat.
